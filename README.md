# Quiz Games and CAPTCHA Systems

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts for developing interactive quiz games and CAPTCHA systems. The projects aim to provide fun and engaging ways to test knowledge and ensure human interaction, respectively.

## Projects

### 1. Quiz Game
- **Description:** A simple command-line quiz application that allows users to answer a series of questions, provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers, keeps track of the score, and presents a final score at the end.
- **Directory:** `quiz_game`
- **Usage:** Run `quiz_game.py` to start the quiz.

### 2. CAPTCHA System
- **Description:** A Python-based CAPTCHA system to distinguish between human and automated access to websites. Includes generating and validating CAPTCHAs.
- **Directory:** `captcha_system`
- **Usage:** Run `generate_captcha.py` to create a new CAPTCHA. Use `validate_captcha.py` to verify user input against the generated CAPTCHA.
